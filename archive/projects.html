Designed page templated, rimplemented routing and incorporated button functionalities allowing seamless integration of APIs in the front end, along with a real time chat feature which created the frontend style of the app and allowed page navigation easier. Button functionalities allowed the backend APIâ€™s to be implemented in the frontend and the chat feature allowed users to chat with matches in real time with history of messages.
