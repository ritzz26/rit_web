                    Created a version of the Pullscription Web App using Vue.js, Typescript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JS as a part of training to understand
                        frontend and backend tasks thoroughly giving me insight to what frontend needs from backend.<br><br>
                    Optimized and debugged ETL jobs along with tests that imported comic books related data into the database to reduce end-to-end runtimes
                        by 60%.<br><br>
                    Implemented FAST APIs to expose programmatic read and write access to the database to query the imported data. This allowed the
                        frontend team to create a UI for admin users to manage the our catalogs easily.<br><br>
                    Built an error logging and collection system. This enabled us to build real-time alerts, reducing response times to outages by 80%.<br><br>

                    Developed a photogrammetric 3D scanner under $1000 using Arduinos in serial communication to scan donor to be passed through a matching algorithm. The algorithm finds the best match for patientâ€™s knee arthroplasty. Implemented Camera movement using the Servo and Stepper motors in a loop to be able to take photos from different angles allowing accuracy to be as close as possible to a $45000 scanner.<br><br>
