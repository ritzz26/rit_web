                    Optimized and debugged ETL jobs along with tests that imported comic books related data into the database to reduce end-to-end runtimes

                    Implemented FAST APIs to expose programmatic read and write access to the database to query the imported data. This allowed the

                    Built an error logging and collection system. This enabled us to build real-time alerts, reducing response times to outages by 80%.<br><br>

                Developed an application backed by OpenAI, to assist tourists in making their trips as a personal project. Included features such as timetables to allow visualization of the plans and filters for searches which helped with prompt engineering. Worked on Firebase Database using Typescript. Created and stylized a login page using GoogleOAuth and Email options for signing in. Worked on storing and displaying previous trips for specific users in Firebase allowing them to make different versions of the trips that they want to plan.

                Created Game using VGA display and FPGA board on Verilog. This game was created for Nostalgic gamers to play the game with more erratic ghost movement that followed PacMan as opposed to more random movement. Worked on collision detection, display, scoring, button movement and dynamic ghost movement.<br><br>
